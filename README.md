# Patent DApp - README

Welcome to the Patent DApp project repository! This decentralized application (DApp) is built on the Binance Smart Chain (BSC) and allows users to register, search, and interact with patents. Users can register new patents, search for patents by ID, and view a list of all registered patents.

## Overview

The Patent DApp simplifies the process of managing and interacting with patents. It leverages the Binance Smart Chain (BSC) for secure and efficient patent registration and retrieval.

## Features

- Register new patents with ease.
- Search for patents by their unique ID.
- View a list of all registered patents.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up the project locally and start using the Patent DApp.

### Prerequisites

- Node.js: Ensure Node.js is installed. Download it from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org).

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/sidrahh12/Sidrah-Ahmed-Final-Project.git
   ```
   
2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd Sidrah-Ahmed-Final-Project
   ```
   
3. Install required npm packages:

   ```bash
    npm install
   ```

### Usage
1. Start the development server:

```bash
npm start
```

2. Open your web browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000 to access the Patent DApp.

3. Connect your Binance Smart Chain wallet (e.g., MetaMask with BSC network) to the DApp.

4. Register new patents, search for existing patents, and interact with the DApp.


### Smart Contracts
The smart contract in this project is responsible for managing patents. It handles patent registration and retrieval. The smart contract is deployed on the Binance Smart Chain (BSC).

PatentdApp.sol: Manages the registration and retrieval of patents.
Testing
Smart contract tests are located in the test folder. These tests ensure the correct functioning of the smart contract. To run the tests, follow these steps:

1. Open a terminal in the project directory.

2. Run the following command to execute the tests:
    ```bash
    truffle test
    ```
    This command will initiate the smart contract tests and display the results in the terminal.
 
### Frontend

The DApp frontend is built using modern web technologies, including React.js. It provides an intuitive and interactive user interface for patent registration and search.

React.js: Powers the DApp's user interface.
Web3.js: The Ethereum JavaScript API for Binance Smart Chain interaction.
MetaMask (BSC): A popular wallet extension for the Binance Smart Chain.
